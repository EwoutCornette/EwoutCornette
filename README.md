## Portfolio of Ewout Cornette 


## Sofware Projects  

**Testing Framewor]**  
A modular Flask-based framework for automating PCB functional tests, integrating PostgreSQL for data management, and using Pytest for automated testing.

- Implemented Ethernet communication for interacting with test equipment.
- Created templates for equipment devices to streamline configuration and test the equiment.
- Migrated the database from SQLite to PostgreSQL for improved scalability.
- Applied design patterns (Factory, Singleton) for modularity, reusability, and extensibility.
- Used Flask Blueprints for a layered architecture, organizing the application into clear components.
- Started unit testing code with unittest and Pytest, with room for further improvement in coverage.

 **Power Test for 6kW Amplifier**  
- Automated control of **power instruments** and **cooling system data collection**.  
- Synchronized **18 MLX90640 thermal cameras** for detailed heat distribution analysis.  

**Test Setup for STM32F407IGTx**  
- Implemented a **TCP server on STM32** for communication with a **Python GUI client**.  
- Developed **functional tests** for **I2C and SPI components**.  
- Used **FreeRTOS** to handle **parallel internal tests** and TCP communication.  

**Test Setup for RF Measurement Board**  
- Developed **C drivers** for **AD7689, SSD1306, MCP2317, and IS62_65WVS2**.  
- Integrated drivers into **C++ test software** for a fully automated test system. 


## Hardware Projects  

**DC Control Test Setup for Current Trip Detection**
Designed and built a PC-based test setup to test whether a board trips at a specific current.
Implemented a linear current ramp from a capacitor into inductors.

**Processor Connector Test Board**
Developed a test board for processor connectors with SPI to Ethernet communication.

- Used impedance-matched lines for reliable signal transmission.
- Configured power setup and safety protocols for stable operation.
- Implemented voltage measurement for accurate monitoring.
- Created a web interface for I/O expanders to manage connections to specific connectors.
